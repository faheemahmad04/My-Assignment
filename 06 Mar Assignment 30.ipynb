    "Ans: Statistics gives us methods of gaining knowledge from data. It is used in all kinds of science and business applications. It gives us more accurate knowledge which helps us make better decisions. It can focus on making predictions about what will happen in the future. It can also focus on explaining how different things are connected."

Measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, range, and quartiles are used in descriptive statistics to describe the main features of a collection of data quantitatively. For example, if you have the scores of 100 students in a math test, you can use descriptive statistics to find out the average score (mean), the score in the middle (median), the score that appears most frequently (mode), and the spread of scores (range or standard deviation).\n",

Inferential statistics are valuable when examination of each member of an entire population is not convenient or possible. For example, if you want to know the average height of people in your city, it’s not feasible to measure everyone’s height. Instead, you can measure the heights of a random sample of individuals and use inferential statistics to estimate the average height of all people in your city."
